# TODO list all LQ analyses:
############################

High priority:
----------------
- perform studies on lepton-vertex and jet-vertex association
- Define procedure to combine lljj and lnjj

Low priority:
---------------
- define estimator for discovery: ScP?
- Check cl95 code implemented in RooStats
  --> see http://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?contribId=25&sessionId=2&resId=0&materialId=slides&confId=106675 
  --> PhysicsTools/RooStatsCms/macros/examples/roostats_cl95_bc.C

# TODO list for eejj analysis:
##############################

High priority:
----------------
- check electron efficiency as a function of i) jet multiplicity , ii) number of primary vertices 
  --> sent request to HEEP group


Low priority:
---------------
- move to PFjets (already done in enujj analysis)
- check if cuts optimized for exclusion are good also for discovery


###############################
# TODO list for enujj analysis:
###############################

High priority:
----------------

- Write AN/PAS
  --> Tentative deadline for AN/PAS or AN/PAPER is Nov. 26

- Redo optimization with QCD background included (waiting for deltaR(e,j) and eta ele/jets)

- Norm. W
  - do it at the Jacobian W peak in MT distribution
  - check if the rescaling is the same for W+ and W- (assume same fake rate for + and - to start with)

- Study ele and MET asymmetry in phi distribution 
  --> separate barrel/endcap + study phi as a function of PtEle/ST

- Uncertainty on W background
   - Is dominant contribution from 
    1) very off-shell Ws with "low" Pt or 
    2) "medium" off-shell Ws with "large" Pt ?
   - which is the uncertainty on W pT spectrum ?
   - is data data driven method needed?

- Study events in the ST tails after full selection (NOT DONE YET)
 ==> make these studies after removing all the deltaPhi cuts to let more background in the final sample
 ==> prepare skim of events in DATA passing full selection (not ST cut)
 - study QCD background from b's 
 - look at charge/eta of electrons in data to guess origin of events 

- Study effect of pile-up on enujj analysis
   --> MET smearing using METx,y from minbias events + <number of pile-up interactions> per event
   --> check probability to have W-->enu + di-jet, simulating LQ enujj final state 
   --> MC sampels with pile-up? rescaling as done in 
       http://test-tschudi.web.cern.ch/test-tschudi/Thesis_Study/Comparison/Comparaison_Data_MC.pdf


Low priority:
---------------

- Njet plot should be done with JEC uncert. included
- Study asymmetry in QCD eta 1st jet distribution
- Understand data MC disagreement in the MT(e,MET) region
  --> study possible variation of fake rate as a function of the distance between electron and jet 
  (see Sara's email in "Re: Studies on QCD sample for LQ1 enujj analysis", Nov 2,3 2010)
- Study two bumps in Mej distribution for 15.1 pb-1
- calculate fake rate + and - 
- Check MC estimation of TTBAR background: emujj, b-jets, high jet multiplicity bins
- Develop data driven method for W+jets estimation
- Contact Gavin Hesketh about MC generators to get W Pt spectrum: FEWZ, ResBos, ..
- check range of W width generated in MC
- look at uT = MET - Pt(e) ~ HT (vectorial sum) to possibly discriminate between W+jets and signal
- estimate QCD contribution from events with real MET (b,c decays to electron)
- Evaluate impact of filters/recovery algorithms from events with lost energy in ECAL dead cells 
  (once filters available at https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SusyEcalMaskedCellSummary )

# TODO list for the RootTupleMakerV2 package:
#############################################


High priority:
----------------
- Create reduced ntuples for events in data passing pre-selection
- add variables for jet-vertex and lepton-vertex association
- use recipe to fix ECAL spike cleaning in 38x
  --> see https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/ecal-performance/394.html
- inlcude type1 corrections for PFMET (ongoing)
- use recipe to fix EB alignment in 2010B data
  --> see https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/exotica/886.html

Low priority:
---------------
- revisit procedure to store trigger info in the ntuples (ask Sam Harper)
- include other PF objets as electrons,photons,muons (PF2PAT)
- use 38x JEC

#################################################
# TODO list for the rootNtupleAnalyzerV2 package
# and plotting macros:
#################################################

High priority:
----------------
- add options for i)statistics box and ii) overflow bin 
  in the .py macros to make final plots
- add chi2 and chi2-probability to all the data/MC comparisons 

Low priority:
---------------

- use correct weights when filling all types of automatic histograms.
  Currently, only XXX_allPreviousCuts are filled with the correct weight.
- remove errRelN*errRelN from 
  http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/UserCode/Leptoquarks/rootNtupleAnalyzerV2/scripts/combineTablesTemplate.py?revision=1.3&view=markup and test it.
- fix code to make cut optimization 
  1) fix code to accept non-integer numbers
  2) allow configurable number of bins for the scan (Edmund wrote already this code?)

Wishes:
------

- make a function to create and fill new histograms using a simple call from the 
  user .C code. The histogram would be created at the first call.
