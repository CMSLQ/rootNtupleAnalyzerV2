TODO list for the rootNtupleAnalyzerV2 package:

Priorities:
----------


Lower priorities:
----------------

- use correct weights when filling all types of automatic histograms.
  Currently, only XXX_allPreviousCuts are filled with the correct weight.


Wishes:
------

- make a function to create and fill new histograms using a simple call from the 
  user .C code. The histogram would be created at the first call.
