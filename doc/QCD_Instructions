Predicting N_eejj from QCD and the closure test:
1) Run analysisClass_SCFakeRate.C with similarly labeled cut table on data.  
   This will produce histograms with distributions of HEEP electrons and isolated
   superculsters passing the di-jet like cuts.
   More specific instructions and explanations are in the code itself.

2) Edit the pyroot macro QCD_FakeRate_fitting.py to take use the output of 
   analysisClass_SCFakeRate.C as the input.
   Run this macro to produce fake rate plots for the endcap and barrel 
   and to perform the linear fit.
   The fit parameters are printed to the screen, the barrel first and then the endcap.

3) Adjust the fake rate fit parameters in the cutTable_SCPredictions.txt
   and run analysisClass_SCPredictions.C on the data.
   This produces histograms for pT and ST distributions for the
   "ttjj" sample, which corresponds to the N_eejj sample.
   The integral of this histogram is the predicted number of N_eejj events
   and the number of entries is the number of ssjj events reweighted.
   The distributions for "tsj" are for electron-supercluster-jet events
   for the closure test.  There is a histogram for "actual" and a histogram for
   "predicted".
   More detailed instructions are contained in the code itself.

Predicting number of events at pre-cuts levels:
1) Adjust the cutTable_eejjSample.txt to make sure the requirement of 2 electrons
   is the first analysis specific cut (after beam scraping, good vertex, etc.).
   Edit analysisClass_eejj_QCD.C to contain the correct fake rate value for barrel
   and endcap.
   Run analysisClass_eejj_QCD.C.
   Histograms are filled with weights assuming exactly 2 superclusters in the event
   and that both convert to HEEP electrons.
